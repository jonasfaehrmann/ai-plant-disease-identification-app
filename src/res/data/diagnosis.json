      "What is it? \n\nGray leaf spot (GLS) is a common fungal disease in the United States caused by the pathogen Cercospora zeae-maydis in corn. Disease development is favored by warm temperatures, 80°F or 27 °C; and high humidity, relative humidity of 90% or higher for 12 hours or more. Cercospora zeae-maydis overwinters in corn residue, allowing inoculum to build up from year to year in fields. \n\nHow can you fight it? \n\n1. Crop rotation away from corn can reduce disease pressure, but multiple years may be necessary in no-till scenarios. \n2. Planting hybrids with a high level of genetic resistance can help reduce the risk of yield loss due to gray leaf spot infection. \n3.

The psyllid feeds on the stems and leaves of the trees, infecting the trees with the bacteria that causes citrus greening. Greening impairs the tree’s ability to take in nourishment, ultimately resulting in fewer and smaller fruit over time. Once a tree is infected, there is no cure. \n\nHow can you fight it? \n\nFor now, there is no cure for HLB, and no resistant citrus varieties are available.

Choose resistant varieties when possible. \n2. Keep your peach trees healthy by properly pruning out any diseased or dead limbs and fertilize and water as necessary. Too much nitrogen can aggravate the disease. \n3. While there are no completely successful sprays for control of this disease, chemical spray with copper based bactericide and the antibiotic oxytetracycline have some effect used preventatively. Talk to your local extension office or nursery for information.

The centers of the blotches become brownish. \n\nHow can you fight it? \n\n1. Remove the older and infected leaves from runner plants before setting. \n2. Take care in spacing runner plants in matted-row culture. \n3. Plant in light, well-drained soil in a location exposed to all-day sun and good air circulation. \n4. Control weeds in the planting. Weeds reduce air circulation and increase drying time for leaves. (Leaves stay wet longer in weedy plantings.) \n5. Removing infected leaves after harvest (during renovation) is helpful in reducing inoculum and controlling all the leaf diseases. \n\nMore information: \nhttps://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/plpath-fru-35",

Early blight can affect seedlings but is generally observed on older plants and is especially severe on plants of poor vigor. \n\nHow can you fight it? \n\n1. Plant resistant varieties. Varieties such as ‘Early Cascade’, ‘Floramerica’, ‘Jetstar’, ‘Manlucie’, ‘Supersonic’, and ‘Surecrop’ have some tolerance to early blight. \n2. Maintain plant vigor. Stressed plants are more susceptible to early blight. Water the plants regularly, but don't fertilize until the plants are well-established and in full blossom. Do not mulch until the soil is warm. \n3. Do a thorough cleanup of the garden in the fall. Remove plant debris or till it into the soil. Pull weeds that compete for light, water, and nutrients, especially nightshade, horse nettle, and other weeds in the tomato family. \n\nMore information: \nhttps://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/fungal-spots/early-blight-of-tomato.aspx#:~:text=Early%20Blight%20of%20Tomato&text=Early%20blight%20is%20a%20fungal,on%20tomatoes%20throughout%20North%20America.&text=Plants%20infected%20with%20the%20fungus,is%20the%20most%20common%20symptom.

It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods. \n\nHow can you fight it? \n\n1. Remove diseased leaves. If caught early, the lower infected leaves can be removed and burned or destroyed. However, removing leaves above where fruit has formed will weaken the plant and expose fruit to sunscald. \n2. Improve air circulation around the plants. If the plants can still be handled without breaking them, stake or cage the plants to raise them off the ground and promote faster drying of the foliage. \n3. Mulch around the base of the plants. Mulching will reduce splashing soil, which may contain fungal spores associated with debris. Apply mulch after the soil has warmed. \n\nMore information: \nhttps://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/fungal-spots/septoria-leaf-spot-of-tomato.aspx#:~:text=Septoria%20leaf%20spot%20is%20caused,weather%20persists%20for%20extended%20periods.&text=Septoria%20leaf%20spot%20usually%20appears,after%20the%20first%20fruit%20sets.
